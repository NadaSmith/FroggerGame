# FroggerGame
Simple frogger game that utilizes the canvas element to create user and obstacles.

# Description
My frogger game is a simple application based on the old arcade game titled the same name - Frogger. The frog must maneuver through the cars without getting hit from sidewalk to sidewalk. Then the frog must make it across the river by successfully jumping from log to log before safely making it to the beach.
